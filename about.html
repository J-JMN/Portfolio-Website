            <h2><u>Rooted in Experience, Focused on Growth</u></h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my About page! I’m Joseph Mburu, and I’m excited to share a bit about my journey and the passions that drive me. Coming from a humble background, I’ve always believed in the power of critical thinking and creativity to navigate challenges and seize opportunities. These experiences have shaped me into someone who is constantly seeking growth and innovation, both in my professional and personal pursuits.

                Currently, I am pursuing my passion for technology through my studies at Moringa School, where I am developing my skills in software engineering. The rigorous curriculum has given me a solid foundation in coding and problem-solving, and I thrive on taking on complex challenges that push me to continuously learn and improve. My interest in technology extends beyond the classroom, as I am also an avid gamer. Gaming not only allows me to unwind but also strengthens my strategic thinking and collaboration skills as I engage with others in immersive digital environments.

                In addition to my passion for technology, I find inspiration and balance through hiking. The time I spend in nature provides me with the opportunity to reflect, recharge, and gain fresh perspectives. I also have a deep affection for cats, whose independent and playful nature reminds me to approach life with curiosity and an open mind. These passions—technology, gaming, hiking, and my love for cats—serve as the foundation for my critical and creative approach to challenges, and I am always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities for growth and collaboration.
